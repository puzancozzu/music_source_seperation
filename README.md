# Music source separation
Music source separation is a computational technique used to extract individual sound sources from a mixed audio signal. It aims to isolate specific instruments, vocals, or other elements within a musical composition, allowing for a more detailed analysis or manipulation of each component. Various methods and algorithms, such as blind source separation and deep learning approaches, have been employed to achieve this task. Music source separation has applications in audio editing, remixing, and music production, as it enables artists and engineers to have greater control over the individual elements of a recording. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in areas like automatic transcription, where separating different sources enhances the accuracy of transcribing musical content.
